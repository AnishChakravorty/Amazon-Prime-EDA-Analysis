## 📌 Business Recommendations

### 1. 🌍 Strengthen International Catalog
- Increase content variety from underrepresented countries to attract global users.
- Include more regional genres to diversify offerings and increase engagement.

### 2. 🎯 Optimize Genre Mix
- Drama and Comedy dominate — focus on hybrid genres (e.g., Comedy-Drama) to keep content fresh.
- Invest in thrillers and documentaries which show emerging viewer interest.

### 3. ⏱ Target Optimal Duration
- Most movies fall under 90–120 minutes. Target this range while exploring mini-series formats.
- Short-form content is ideal for mobile viewers — consider more of it.

### 4. 📅 Maintain a Consistent Release Flow
- Avoid clustering releases in a few months. Distribute throughout the year for better visibility and retention.

### 5. 🧠 Enhance Recommendation Systems
- Use data-driven insights (e.g., genre, duration, region) to personalize recommendations.
- Highlight trending content by country and rating to surface popular titles.
